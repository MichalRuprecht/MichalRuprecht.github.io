      <h3>
        My name is Michal and I've traveled to 36 countries and 5 continents since 2000. It all started with my dad’s dream to travel the world. He grew up in communist Poland, where it was nearly impossible to obtain a passport and travel. His dad (my grandfather) was also disabled, making it difficult to even travel within the country.
        <br><br>Several decades later, my parents were fortunate enough to immigrate to America. My dad’s dream continued even after my sister and I were born. Our first country was England and we have continued traveling ever since, sharing snapshots and stories of our travel with our homebound grandfather and others.
