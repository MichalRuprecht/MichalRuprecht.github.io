      <h3>My name is Michal Ruprecht and I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan and beat reporter at <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Michigan Daily</i></a>. <i>The Michigan Daily</i> is the only daily newspaper in Washtenaw County and Ann Arbor with a circulation of 7,500. I manage and write content for the research section of the paper. I've been a student journalist since my freshman year of high school, which makes this my sixth year as a student journalist. Throughout the years, I've learned the importance of student journalism and our role as watchdogs and storytellers. This portfolio is a manifest of what I have learned and how I've evolved. I'm a National Scholastic Press Association Honor Roll Student Journalist and I've received individual Michigan Interscholastic Press Association awards for my news and feature writing.

      <br />This was one of the biggest research papers to come out of the University. Everyone was covering the research, which the lead researcher described as a 'double-edged sword' during our interview. The reason for this analogy: many journalists began to misinterpret the research and inaccurately write about it. In his eyes, thse inaccuracies could lead to negative public opinion, damaging the field of work he's worked so hard in. Therefore, it was very important for me to be very accurate throughout the interview and story. Although there weren't any inaccuracies in the story, I wish I had gotten an interview with a bioethicist to get another perspective. I had emailed several bioethicists, however, none responded by publishing time.

        <br />This is was my first piece for <i>The Michigan Daily</i> and I had the opportunity to tell the story of an 80-year-old business at the verge of dissapearing, without any successors. The business owner's quotes made the story powerful, rich with emotion and history. Despite the uncertainty of the business's longevity, the owner comes to the realization that his work has been rewarding at the end of the interview and story.
