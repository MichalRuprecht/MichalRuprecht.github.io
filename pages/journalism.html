      <h3>My name is Michal Ruprecht and I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan and beat reporter at <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Michigan Daily</i></a>. <i>The Michigan Daily</i> is the only daily newspaper in Washtenaw County and Ann Arbor with a circulation of 7,500. I manage and write content for the research section of the paper. I've been a student journalist since my freshman year of high school, which makes this my sixth year as a student journalist. Throughout the years, I've learned the importance of student journalism and our role as watchdogs and storytellers. This portfolio is a manifest of what I have learned and how I've evolved. I'm a National Scholastic Press Association Honor Roll Student Journalist and I've received individual Michigan Interscholastic Press Association awards for my news and feature writing.

      <br />This was one of the biggest research papers to come out of the University. Everyone was covering the research, which the lead researcher described as a 'double-edged sword' during our interview. The reason for this analogy: many journalists began to misinterpret the research and inaccurately write about it. In his eyes, these inaccuracies could lead to negative public opinion, damaging the field of work he's worked so hard in. Therefore, it was very important for me to be very accurate throughout the interview and story. Although there weren't any inaccuracies in the story, I wish I had gotten an interview with a bioethicist to get another perspective. I had emailed several bioethicists, however, none responded by publishing time.

      <br />My co-by liner and I finished writing this piece minutes before publishing. After being notified about the debate one hour before it began, we rushed to the venue and prepared questions for the candidates. This story was particularly difficult because we had to moderate the debate and finish writing a summary of the debate at the end. At the beginning of the writing process, we weren't coordinating the work well. Shortly after, we devised a plan to transcribe the most important parts of the two-hour-long recording of the debate. Another challenge we had was writing a balanced story, with all of the candidates' views and policies included. Although there was a large learning curve, we wrote a successful story before publishing time.

        <br />This is was my first piece and I had the opportunity to tell the story of an 80-year-old business on the verge of disappearing, without any successors. The business owner's quotes made the story powerful, rich with emotion and history. I also included this piece in my portfolio because I had a lot of trouble finding additional sources to speak to. After brainstorming with my team, we came up with the idea of searching through the business' Google Reviews to find customers we could talk to about the business. Despite the uncertainty of the business's longevity, the owner comes to the realization that his work has been rewarding at the end of the interview and story.
