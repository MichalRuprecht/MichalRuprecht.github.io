          <h2>About me</h2>
          <h3>I'm a first generation American and I’m passionate about diverse learning environments, learning about other people's struggles, and emphasizing social justice in underserved communities like Flint, MI. I'm looking for opportunities that include or combine my passions for neuroscience, medicine, and social justice.</h3>

            <li><big>Production of a new series of ligands with potential to act as water remediators</big>
              <h3>
                In this Flint water crisis-inspired and green chemistry research project, a group of high schoolers, including me, created a molecule that binds to other molecules, called a ligand, capable of removing harmful substances from tainted water. We worked with Mark Benvenuto, Ph.D. at the University of Detroit Mercy to uphold the principles of green chemistry by creating a ligand that is cheap, easy-to-use, and environmentally-friendly. Our goal was to positively impact Michiganders affected by the Flint water crisis.
                <button class="collapsible"></button><div class="content">
                  Our research showed that if our ligand could pull metal ions into a nonpolar solution called monoglyme, it should be able to pull metal ions out of aqueous solution.
                  <br />I received the 2017 American Chemical Society Ciba Travel Grant in Green Chemistry as the first high schooler recipient. This grant covered the costs for me to attend the American Chemical Society National Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts. My abstract was accepted into the Sci-Mix and Division of Environmental Chemistry poster sessions of the national conference, with the Sci-Mix poster session consisting of abstracts selected by division program chairs and represents the most exceptional abstracts submitted to participating divisions.
                  <br />Our research was published in <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/psr.ahead-of-print/psr-2018-0076/psr-2018-0076.xml" target="_blank"><I>Physical Sciences Reviews</i></a>.
                  <br />Additional information: My group and I also presented at the ACS Central Regional Conference in Dearborn, Michigan as the only high school group there. <a href="https://gpnchemclub.weebly.com/uploads/9/2/1/3/92132418/abstract158.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to view our abstract from the conference</a>.

              <h3>
                I received a full-tuition scholarship and conducted extensive, ten-day, graduate-level developmental neuroscience research with a group of high schoolers. I collaborated with the scientific community, including predecessors in the program, to present research and publish data. We conducted our research at Coastal Marine Biolabs through the <a href="https://NeuroLabSEPA.org" target="_blank">NeuroLab Program</a>, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health, and we were supervised by Ralph Imondi, Ph.D. and Linda Santschi, Ph.D.

            <li><big>Role of the microRNA-183/96/182 cluster in pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced keratitis</big>
              <h3>
                I cold-called over 100 professors about research positions that interested me and I chose to work alongside Shunbin Xu, M.D., Ph.D. at the Wayne State University School of Medicine to conduct immunology-focused research. microRNA is a newly-acknowledged level of gene expression regulation and bacterial keratitis is a corneal infection caused by bacteria commonly affecting contact-lens wearers. We specifically examined pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced keratitis, which causes blindness and visual disabilities.
                <button class="collapsible"></button><div class="content">
                  We focused on the role of the microRNA-183/96/182 cluster and ways in which it helps regulate the innate immune response to pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced keratitis infection. We also examined the potential of the anti-microRNAs, which are found in the cluster knockdown, to shield the cornea from unfavorable effects of the disease. Our research is aimed to identify new treatment strategies and therapeutic targets for the disease and other antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and tumors that bypass the immune system.

              <li><big>Resistance of active ingredients to water with calcium hypochlorite</big>
                <h3>
                  In this collaborative research project, we investigated which active ingredient would yield the most resistance to water with calcium hypochlorite, which is added to pools. Throughout the research assignment we were required to create our own procedure without any teacher guidance.
